How to compile ValaCE

= Introduction =

Compiling ValaCE it isn't an easy task, but even not a very difficult one. You'll need to be familiar with the cegcc compiler and you'll need some time.

I tried to automate as much as possible, but there are some manual step that need to be done.

You may ask why? 

These are some reasons:

  # I'm not very good when dealing with GLib automake "pretty complex" build scripts
  # I lack the time and knowledge to do a better work
  # My GLib port is partial and was done with an "axe", not with a bistury!

In the source root directory there is a script called *build-all* that should do most of the work.

=== Required tools ===

To compile ValaCE you need:

  # mingw32ce flavour of the CE Gcc compiler: http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/
  # the Vala compiler: http://live.gnome.org/Vala
  # time & patience

=== Build procedure ===

First edit the *mingw32ce.sh* file present in the root folder to reflect you installation (I installed mingw32ce under ~/opt/mingw32ce/)

Then do:

{{{$source mingw32ce.sh}}}

and finally:

{{{$./build-all}}}

If all goes well you should have the GLib / GObject library built under the _glibce_ folder and the vforms library with some example programs under the _valaforms_ folder.
