My first Vala program for Windows CE

= Introduction =

So you have installed ValaCE and you want use it? Let's go and write a simple Vala program with ValaForms a.k.a. VForms.


= Project structure =

If you followed the Compile instruction you should ended with a copy of all the required library and headers installed in the _wince_ subfolder (e.g. , so now you just need to create a simple folder to store your first program.

So just do a:

{{{mkdir valace-example1}}}

and create there a simple *Makefile* file with the following content:
{{{

}}}

= Program source =

Now create and edit a vala source with the name *example1.vala* always inside the same folder.

This is the program source

{{{
/* first simple example */

using VForms;
using Windows;

static int WinMain(Instance instance, Instance prev_instance, StringW? args, int show_mode)
{
	VForms.init (instance);
	MessageBox.show ("Hello ValaCE!", "ValaCE Example");
	return VForms.loop_run ();
}
}}}

Compile it with _make_ and copy the required files to the device. If you want can modify the *ce-deploy* script found in the valaforms subfolder of the source distribution.

Enjoy!
