THE ValaCE PROJECT

The ValaCE project was born just as a proof of concept to see if
Vala could be used for developing Windows CE applications.

It was developed and a few nights and weekends and tested only on
my Htc phone so don't expect to be very complete or that it works
everywhere.

It consists of:

	* GLibCE: a port of glib / gobject / gthread to Windows CE
	* windows.vapi: vala bindings to the Win32 C interface
	* valaforms: a simple library that wraps the Win32 UI controls
                     in a more object oriented way.

WHY "Vala"?

Vala is a new object oriented language similar but not equal to C#
and it uses GLib and GObject for the foundation of its object type 
system.

So Vala properties, classes interfaces and events can be just thought
as a nice and convenient syntax around the gobject capabilities.

The main advantage of Vala upon C# is that the code is compiled in
machine language and more over that you have a strict control on 
the generated C interface and ABI.

Memory is automatically managed at compile time using reference counted
objects, this permits to still have a certain degree of control on 
when allocate & deallocate it, but also free the developer to think
every time about leaks etc...
